# Background
As I wanted to begin my own Data Career I decided to look at some of the jobs to hone my skills. This way I would have a great set of skills to show when applying for Jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer were:

1. What are the top paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top paying jobs?
3. What skills are in high demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the best skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

For this project there were several tools that I used, there were:
- SQL: As stated this was a project to focus on expanding my SQL knowledge, By using SQL I was able to query the data and find the answers to my questions
- PostgresSQL: This was the database management tool that I setup  to use for the project
- VSCode: I have been using VSCode for a while now and it helps keep things managable. I reccomend using VSCode for any programming related project as I have used it in the past for data science projects with python
- Github: If you are viewing this you can already tell that I am using Github! Github is great for version control and collaboration, although this was a solo project.'
